               <h5> Firebase</h5>
               <p>
                <p>In the era of rapid prototyping, we can get bright ideas, but sometimes they are not applicable if they take too much work. Often, the back-end is the limiting factor - many considerations never apply to server-side coding due to lack of knowledge or time.</p>
                <p>Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service(BaaS) which started as a YC11 startup. It grew up into a next-generation app-development platform on Google Cloud Platform. Firebase (a NoSQLjSON database) is a real-time database that allows storing a list of objects in the form of a tree. We can synchronize data between different devices.</p>
               </p>
               <p>
                <p><strong>Firebase</strong>&nbsp;evolved from&nbsp;<strong>Envolve</strong>. Envolve is a prior startup founded by&nbsp;<strong>James Tamplin</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Andrew Lee</strong>&nbsp;in 2011. Envolve provided developers an API which allowed the integration of online chat functionality into their websites. After releasing the chat service, it found that the envlove was being used to pass application data, which were not chat messages. Developers used Envolve to sync application to separate the real-time architecture and the chat system which powered it. In September 2011, Tamplin and Lee founded firebase as a separate company. It was lastly launched to the public in April 2012.</p>
                <p>Firebase Real-time Database was the first product of firebase. It is an API which syncs application data across Android, iOS, and Web devices. It gets stored on Firebase's cloud. Then the firebase real-time database helps the developers to build real-time, collaborative applications.</p>

                    <li>Firebase manages real-time data in the database. So, it easily and quickly exchanges the data to and from the database. Hence, for developing mobile apps such as live streaming, chat messaging, etc., we can use Firebase.</li>
                    <li>Firebase allows syncing real-time data across all devices - iOS, Android, and Web - without refreshing the screen.</li>
                    <li>Firebase provides integration to Google Advertising, AdMob, Data Studio, BigQuery DoubleClick, Play Store, and Slack to develop our apps with efficient and accurate management and maintenance.</li>
                    <li>Everything from databases, analytics to crash reports are included in Firebase. So, the app development team can stay focused on improving the user experience.</li>
                    <li>Firebase applications can be deployed over a secured connection to the firebase server.</li>
                    <li>Firebase offers a simple control dashboard.</li>
                    <li>It offers a number of useful services to choose from.</li>

                    <li>It has minimal setup.</li>
                    <li>It provides three-way data binding via angular fire.</li>
                    <li>It provides simple serialization of app state.</li>
                    <li>We can easily access data, files, auth, and more.</li>
                    <li>There is no server infrastructure required to power apps with data.</li>
                    <li>It has JSON storage, which means no barrier between data and objects.</li>

                The analytics dashboard is one of the best features of Firebase, which is equipped with. It is free and can report 500 event types, each with 25 attributes. The dashboard is top-notch for observing user behavior and measuring various user characteristics. Ultimately it helps us to understand how people use our app so that we can better optimize it in the future.
               </p>
               <p>
                With Firebase, we can focus our time and attention on developing the best possible applications for our business. The operation and internal functions are very solid. They have taken care of the Firebase Interface. We can spend more time in developing high-quality apps that users want to use.

                There are the following features which we can develop:
